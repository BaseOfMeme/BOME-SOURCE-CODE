# Book of Base Token

## Overview
`BookOfBaseToken` is an ERC20 token contract that incorporates additional management features such as a blacklist and holding limits. It is designed for use on the Ethereum network and is compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts v4.4.0.

## Features
- **ERC20 Standard**: Fully compatible with the ERC20 standard for tokens.
- **Blacklist**: The owner can add addresses to a blacklist, prohibiting them from sending and receiving tokens.
- **Holding Limits**: The owner can set maximum and minimum amounts of tokens that an address can hold.
- **Token Burning**: Users can burn their tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **Uniswap Integration**: Integration with Uniswap for managing token trading.
